# Building Computational Models of Child Word Learning: Case Studies on Transitional Probability and Chunking

**Workshop date & location:**  
*23â€“27 June 2025, University of Birmingham, UK (MEDAL Summer School in Computational Modelling [link](https://medal.ut.ee/event/medal-summer-school-in-computational-linguistics/))*

## Overview

This hands-on workshop is designed for students and researchers in psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, and related fields who are interested in applying computational methods to language research. The workshop focuses on two influential theories in child language acquisition:

1. **Transitional Probability**  
   - Explains how infants discover words in fluent speech using statistical cues.

2. **Chunking**  
   - Captures how children build a vocabulary through exposure to parental input.

By the end of the workshop, participants will:
- Have a foundation for integrating computational modelling into their research workflow.
- Obtain Jupyter notebooks covering all workshop activities:  
  - Model input preprocessing  
  - Model implementation  
  - Output visualisation  
  - Model evaluation using real and simulated data

## Workshop Format

1. **Introduction & Theory**  
   - Familiarise yourself with the theoretical background of transitional probability and chunking in language acquisition.

2. **Practical Coding Sessions**  
   - Implement models in Python and experiment with real and simulated datasets.

3. **Results & Discussion**  
   - Align model outputs with infant behavioural data.  
   - Explore how manipulating a chunking-based system and its input affects vocabulary acquisition.
